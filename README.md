This is a demo where the user can generate new environments and objects in a 3D world using natural language, and explore the world with FPS controls. It is powered by [window.ai](https://windowai.io/) 3D object generation with OpenAI's [Shap-E](https://github.com/openai/shap-e).

You are able to download the generated .ply files, and upload them as well. Feel free to share in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/7KkS3r5hGK)!

The code is based on the [window.ai Generative 3D demo](https://github.com/NolanGC/window-3d-demo) and [Three.js Octree FPS demo](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=games#games_fps).
