# world-generation-demo

**Demo**: https://world-generation-demo.vercel.app/

This is a demo where the user can generate new environments and objects in a 3D world using natural language. It is powered by [window.ai](https://windowai.io/) 3D object generation with OpenAI's [Shap-E](https://github.com/openai/shap-e).

The code is based on the [Three.js Octree FPS demo](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=games#games_fps).
